#' performs sector-based single-level attribution
#' 
#' Performs sector-based single-level attribution analysis. Portfolio 
#' performance measured relative to a benchmark gives an indication of the 
#' value-added by the portfolio. Equipped with weights and returns of portfolio
#' segments, we can dissect the value-added into useful components. This 
#' function is based on the sector-based approach to the attribution. The 
#' workhorse is the Brinson model that explains the arithmetic difference 
#' between portfolio and benchmark returns. That is it breaks down the 
#' arithmetic excess returns at one level. If returns and weights are available
#' at the lowest level (e.g. for individual instruments), the aggregation up to
#' the chosen level from the hierarchy can be done using 
#' \code{\link{Return.level}} function. The attribution effects can be computed
#' for several periods. The multi-period summary is obtained using one of 
#' linking methods: Carino, Menchero, GRAP, Frongello or Davies Laker. It also
#' allows to break down the geometric excess returns, which link naturally over
#' time. Finally, it annualizes arithmetic and geometric excess returns 
#' similarly to the portfolio and/or benchmark returns annualization. 
#' 
#' The arithmetic excess returns are decomposed into the sum of allocation, 
#' selection and interaction effects across \eqn{n} sectors:
#' \deqn{R_{p}-R_{b}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\left(A_{i}+S_{i}+I_{i}\right)}
#' The arithmetic attribution effects for the category i are computed
#' as suggested in the Brinson, Hood and Beebower (1986):
#' Allocation effect
#' \deqn{A_{i}=(w_{pi}-w_{bi})\times R_{bi}}{Ai = (wpi - wbi) * Rbi}
#' Selection effect
#' \deqn{S_{i}=w_{pi}\times(R_{pi}-R_{bi})}{Si = wpi * (Rpi - Rbi)}
#' Interaction effect
#' \deqn{I_{i}=(w_{pi}-w_{bi})
#' \times(R_{pi}-R_{bi})}{Ii = (wpi - wbi) * Rpi - Rbi}
#' \eqn{R_{p}}{Rp} - total portfolio returns,
#' \eqn{R_{b}}{Rb} - total benchmark returns, 
#' \eqn{w_{pi}}{wpi} - weights of the category \eqn{i} in the portfolio, 
#' \eqn{w_{bi}}{wbi} - weights of the category \eqn{i} in the benchmark, 
#' \eqn{R_{pi}}{Rpi} - returns of the portfolio category \eqn{i}, 
#' \eqn{R_{bi}}{Rbi} - returns of the  benchmark category \eqn{i}.
#' If Brinson and Fachler (1985) is selected the allocation effect differs:
#' \deqn{A_{i}=(w_{pi}-w_{bi})
#' \times (R_{bi} - R_{b})}{Ai = (wpi - wbi) * (Rbi - Rb)}
#' Depending on goals we can give priority to the allocation or to 
#' the selection effects. If the priority is given to the sector allocation
#' the interaction term will be combined with the security selection effect
#' (top-down approach). If the priority is given to the security selection,
#' the interaction term will be combined with the asset-allocation effect
#' (bottom-up approach).
#' Usually we have more than one period. In that case individual arithmetic 
#' attribution effects should be adjusted using linking methods. Adjusted
#' arithmetic attribution effects can be summed up over time to provide the
#' multi-period summary: 
#' \deqn{R_{p}-R_{b}=\sum^{T}_{t=1}\left(A_{t}'+S_{t}'+I_{t}'\right)}
#' where \eqn{T} is the number of periods and prime stands for the adjustment.
#' The geometric attribution effects do not suffer from the linking problem.
#' Moreover we don't have the interaction term. For more details about the 
#' geometric attribution see the documentation to 
#' \code{\link{Attribution.geometric}}. Finally, arithmetic annualized excess 
#' returns are computed as the arithmetic difference between annualised 
#' portfolio and benchmark returns:
#' \deqn{AAER=r_{a}-b_{a}}{AAER = ra - ba} the geometric annualized excess
#' returns are computed as the geometric difference between annualized 
#' portfolio and benchmark returns: 
#' \deqn{GAER=\frac{1+r_{a}}{1+b_{a}}-1}{GAER = (1 + ra) / (1 + ba) - 1}
#' In the case of multi-currency portfolio, the currency return, currency
#' surprise and forward premium should be specified. The multi-currency
#' arithmetic attribution is handled following Ankrim and Hensel (1992).
#' Currency returns are decomposed into the sum of the currency surprise and
#' the forward premium: \deqn{R_{ci} = R_{cei} + R_{fpi}}{Rci = Rcei + Rfpi}
#' where 
#' \deqn{R_{cei} = \frac{S_{i}^{t+1} - F_{i}^{t+1}}{S_{i}^{t}}}
#' \deqn{R_{fpi} = \frac{F_{i}^{t+1}}{S_{i}^{t}} - 1}
#' \eqn{S_{i}^{t}}{Sit} - spot rate for asset \eqn{i} at time \eqn{t}
#' \eqn{F_{i}^{t}}{Fit} - forward rate for asset \eqn{i} at time \eqn{t}. 
#' Excess returns are decomposed into the sum of allocation, selection and 
#' interaction effects as in the standard Brinson model: 
#' \deqn{R_{p}-R_{b}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\left(A_{i}+S_{i}+I_{i}\right)}
#' However the allocation effect is computed taking into account currency
#' effects:
#' \deqn{A_{i}=(w_{pi}-w_{bi})\times (R_{bi} - R_{ci} - R_{l})}{Ai = 
#' (wpi - wbi) * (Rbi - Rci - Rl)}
#' Benchmark returns adjusted to the currency:
#' \deqn{R_{l} = \sum^{n}_{i=1}w_{bi}\times(R_{bi}-R_{ci})}
#' The contribution from the currency is analogous to asset allocation:
#' \deqn{C_{i} = (w_{pi} - w_{bi}) \times (R_{cei} - e) + (w_{pfi} - w_{bfi}) 
#' \times (R_{fi} - e)}
#' where \deqn{e = \sum^{n}_{i=1}w_{bi}\times R_{cei}}
#' The final term, forward premium, is also analogous to the asset allocation:
#' \deqn{R_{fi} = (w_{pi} - w_{bi}) \times (R_{fpi} - d)}{Rfi = (wpi - wbi) * 
#' (Rfpi - d)}
#' where \deqn{d = \sum^{n}_{i=1}w_{bi}\times R_{fpi}}
#' and \eqn{R_{fpi}} - forward premium
#' In general if the intent is to estimate statistical parameters, the 
#' arithmetic excess return is preferred. However, due to the linking 
#' challenges, it may be preferable to use geometric excess return if the 
#' intent is to link and annualize excess returns.
