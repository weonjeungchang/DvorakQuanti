# portfolioOptimization
An RStudio Shiny app that constructs efficient portfolios based on a simple mean-variance model and a Black-Litterman model. The app outputs percentages to allocate for each asset class.

The BL Model combines investor belief about asset classes into the portfolio optimization model.
